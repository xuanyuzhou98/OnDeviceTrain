Train Reversible Neural Network on mobile devices

Paper for reference:

Useful Resources:
1. The library deeplearning4j we will be using:

2. PyTorch code for i-revnet:

3. Tensorflow code for revnet:

Our goal:
1. Train a small network on mobile device from scratch
2. Few shot learning/finetune a network on mobile device
