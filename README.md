# OnDeviceTrain
Train Neural Network on mobile devices

# Our goal
1. Amount of data is small: Pretrained model + few shot learning: the training data in devices is small.
2. Explore more data types: Currently only using images as input.  Support machine translation etc.
3. Moving from algorithm to application: Write a mobile application with on device training.

# Motivations for On-Device Training
1. Customization: Customized model weights for each device
2. Economy: No data transmission overhead. 
3. Privacy: Data does not leave devices

# Constraints of On-Device Training
1. Memory Limit: 
Total Memory = Parameter Memory + Gradient Memory + Layer Activations Memory. 
2. Speed Limit (FLOPS):
Not a hard limit. We donâ€™t need training to be finished in real-time.
3. Energy/Battery Limit:
Not a hard limit. We can limit training to be only executed during charging.
